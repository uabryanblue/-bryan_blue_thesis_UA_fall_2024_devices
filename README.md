# EFFECTS OF IN SITU LEAF WARMING ON NET PHOTOSYNTHETIC CO~2~ ASSIMILATION IN *THEOBROMA CACAO* L. (cacao):Â  A STUDY IN THE BIOSPHERE 2 TROPICAL RAINFOREST

## Raw Data Content Description
Part of the  bryan_blue_thesis_UA_fall_2024 repo, but contains the novel hardware, code that was used to collect data for the thesis

### TC_Calibration

2 point calibrations were performed for each thermocouple (TC) used in the heating and control device. The TCs were used to measure heating pad and leaf temperatures.

The coefficients were entered into the heating and control device's configuration file to ensure accurate readings for each experiment.
